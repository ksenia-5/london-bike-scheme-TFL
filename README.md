# london-bike-scheme-TFL

A data analysis of the London public bike scheme data. 
<br>
Data includes 1.54 M journeys taken between for 1 August - 19 September 2017, with 773 active stations.
<br>

## Geospatial Data Analysis

Geospatial analysis of station location and station usage was undertaken. A custom boundary is drawn around active stations; the bounded region is split into voronoi sections (polygons) and usage statistics are plotted using Folium. This allows for data visualisation using interactive web-maps.
